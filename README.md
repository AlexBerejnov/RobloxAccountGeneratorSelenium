# RobloxAccountGenerator

Roblox Account Generator for Python, based on Selenium.

Download chromedriver from [this website](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/) and replace it with what you have in the folder

# Requirements
First, run this command in your terminal to install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure your Python version is 3.8 or higher.

Make sure you have Google Chrome installed.


Then, download a chromedriver matching your Google Chrome version
from [this website](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/).

# Cooldowns

Cooldowns are a time unit in seconds between each account generation stored in the "GENERATION_COOLDOWN" variable in main.py

5 seconds is best if you have a bypass for FunCaptcha (name of the captcha that Roblox uses)
Chill mode (135-180) is when the Captcha isn't met. 180 is the one I've been using - no captchas at all (I think)

Have a fun usage.
